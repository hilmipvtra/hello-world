# hello-world
first time trying github

ok IRIS Workshop got me here. Honestly im more interested in the making codes on python3 kinda stuff. This is kinda confusing tbh.
we'll see where this gets me. I might edit this in the future, but for the sake of it this is my initial impression and im gonna write it here.
